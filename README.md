# Opera bookmarks archiver
You can clone this repo and open it as a plugin in your Opera browser (should work on Chrome and probably a few other browsers too). When you click plugin's icon in your browser, it'll open a new page, from file *mypage.html* with a button - when you click it, the script from *code.js* file is going to create a new folder on your main bookmarks bar and **recursively move all of your bookmarks** to this folder. Try it yourself!

# How to use
1. Make a backup of your current bookmarks and favourite websites. Your bookmarks are stored in a file named **Bookmarks** inside Opera's profile folder. It is generally located in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable. You can also backup the **Favicons** file.
2. Clone this repo
3. Go to opera://extensions in your Opera browser
4. Click on "Load unpacked" (or something like that)
5. Select the folder to which you've cloned the repo
6. Almost done! Click on new plugin's icon
7. When you click the 'Dump' button, it's going to its thing
